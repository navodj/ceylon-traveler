## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app installed on your physical Android/iOS device or an emulator/simulator setup.
* Python environment (e.g., v3.8+) for the backend.
* Access to a running instance of the [Ceylon Traveler Backend API](<#link-to-your-backend-repo-if-available>) (locally or deployed).
* Clerk Account and Supabase Account for API keys.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ceylon-traveler.git](https://github.com/your-username/ceylon-traveler.git) 
    cd ceylon-traveler
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Create an environment file:** Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
2.  **Add environment variables:** Populate the `.env` file with your keys and API URL:
    ```env
    # Clerk Publishable Key (Get from Clerk Dashboard)
    EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_YOUR_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"

    # Base URL for your running backend API
    EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://YOUR_BACKEND_IP_ADDRESS:8000" 
    ```
   

### Running the Backend

*(Adjust based on your backend setup)*
1.  Navigate to your backend project directory.
2.  Set up backend environment variables (Supabase, Clerk Secret, ORS API Key).
3.  Install backend dependencies (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
4.  Run the FastAPI server (ensure `--host 0.0.0.0` for device testing):
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload 
    ```

### Running the App

1.  **Start the Expo development server:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
2.  **Open the app:** Scan the QR code with Expo Go or use an emulator/simulator.
